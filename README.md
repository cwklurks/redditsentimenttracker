# Reddit Stock Sentiment Tracker üìà

A real-time sentiment analysis application that monitors stock discussions on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and provides sentiment analysis for mentioned stocks.

## Features

- üîç **Real-time Reddit Scraping**: Fetches hot posts from r/wallstreetbets using public JSON feeds
- üìä **Stock Ticker Extraction**: Identifies stock symbols mentioned in posts and comments
- üí° **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses VADER sentiment analysis to gauge market sentiment
- üìà **Interactive Dashboard**: Clean, responsive Streamlit interface
- üíæ **Smart Caching**: Reduces API calls with intelligent data caching
- üîÑ **Auto-refresh**: Configurable data refresh intervals
- ‚ö° **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback to cached data
- üöÄ **No Setup Required**: Works immediately without any API credentials!

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- **No Reddit API credentials needed!** ‚ú®

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd reddit-sentiment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to view the dashboard.

**That's it!** No configuration files, no API keys, no setup - just run and go! üéâ

## How It Works (No API Required!)

This application uses Reddit's **public JSON feeds** instead of the official API:

- ‚úÖ **Hot posts**: `https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/hot.json`
- ‚úÖ **New posts**: `https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/new.json`
- ‚úÖ **Comments**: `https://www.reddit.com/comments/{post_id}.json`

These are **completely legal** public endpoints that don't require authentication and provide real-time data!

## Configuration Options

### Application Settings

The sidebar includes several configurable options:

- **Reddit Posts to Analyze**: Number of posts to fetch (10-100)
- **Top Stocks to Show**: Number of top mentioned stocks to display (5-20)
- **Refresh Data**: Manual refresh of cached data
- **Force Fresh Data**: Bypass cache and fetch new data

### Feed Types

The app automatically mixes different feeds for optimal sentiment analysis:
- **70% Hot posts**: Popular posts with high engagement and comments
- **30% New posts**: Fresh posts with the latest market sentiment

## Deployment

### Streamlit Cloud

```

## Architecture

### Components

- **`app.py`**: Main Streamlit application and UI
- **`data_controller.py`**: Orchestrates data processing pipeline
- **`reddit_scraper.py`**: Reddit JSON feed integration
- **`stock_extractor.py`**: Stock ticker extraction and validation
- **`sentiment_analyzer.py`**: VADER sentiment analysis
- **`models.py`**: Data models and structures

### Data Flow

1. **Reddit JSON Scraping**: Fetch posts from public JSON endpoints
2. **Ticker Extraction**: Identify stock symbols in posts and comments
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Calculate sentiment scores for each stock
4. **Caching**: Store results to reduce requests
5. **Display**: Present data in interactive dashboard

## Rate Limiting

The application includes built-in rate limiting to be respectful to Reddit:
- **1 second delay** between requests
- **Automatic retry** on failures
- **Smart caching** to minimize requests

No API rate limits to worry about! üéâ

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Data Displayed
- **Causes**: Network issues, Reddit server problems, no stock mentions
- **Solution**: 
  - Check internet connection
  - Try "Force Fresh Data" button
  - Wait a moment and refresh (Reddit may be temporarily busy)

#### Slow Loading
- **Causes**: Network latency, Reddit server load
- **Solution**: 
  - Use cached data when available
  - Reduce number of posts to analyze in settings

#### Connection Errors
- **Error**: "Failed to fetch data from Reddit"
- **Solution**: 
  - Check internet connection
  - Reddit's servers may be temporarily unavailable
  - Try again in a few minutes

### Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Failed to fetch data" | Network or Reddit server issue | Check connection, try again |
| "No stock data found" | No mentions in recent posts | Try different time or wait for new posts |
| "Cache expired" | Old cached data | Click refresh or force fresh data |

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can run with additional logging:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export STREAMLIT_LOGGER_LEVEL=debug
streamlit run app.py
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest test_reddit_scraper.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Self-imposed 1-second delays between requests (to be respectful)
2. **Subreddit Scope**: Currently only monitors r/wallstreetbets
3. **Stock Validation**: Limited to predefined list of valid tickers
4. **Sentiment Accuracy**: VADER is rule-based, may miss context/sarcasm
5. **Historical Data**: No long-term data storage or historical analysis
